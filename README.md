## Is a python code to study probability of lotto numbers

### Lottery Analysis Strategies

### Frequency Analysis
This is the most common approach where you calculate how often each number has been drawn. While past frequency doesn't influence future draws, some people like to choose numbers that have been drawn more frequently (hot numbers) or less frequently (cold numbers).

### Due Numbers
This strategy focuses on numbers that haven't been drawn for a while. The idea is that every number has an equal chance of being drawn, so those that haven't appeared recently are "due" to be drawn. Again, this doesn't influence the actual probability in a random draw.

### Combinations Analysis
Some people analyze the frequency of pairs, triplets, or quadruplets of numbers that tend to appear together.

### Distribution Analysis
Analyze the distribution of numbers to see if they tend to be spread across the entire range or clustered within certain segments.

### Statistical Significance
You can calculate the statistical significance of the frequency of numbers to see if their occurrence is due to random chance or could be statistically significant.

### Random Number Generators
Some people prefer to use random number generators to pick their numbers, relying on pure chance rather than trying to find patterns in past draws.

### Mathematical Systems
Systems like wheeling, which involves creating combinations of a set of numbers, are used by some players. This doesn't increase the chance of winning the jackpot but can increase the chance of winning smaller prizes.

### Historical Trends
Some players look at historical trends, like numbers drawn on certain days of the week, special dates, or anniversaries.



### Question:
#### Q1: What's the point if every extraction is always on the same numbers?
**Answer:** If some numbers occurs more than other in significant way the extraction method is broken
maybe you become rich!
